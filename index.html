      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a hardworking individual with a passion to protect and defend the personal information of others through hardening networks and actively testing them for vulnerabilities. Most people have either seen or been the victim of
        a malicious
        attack
        to some degree or another. I strive to teach my family and friends how to better secure their identities and home offices or networks to prevent these things from happening as much as possible. An avid learner, I strive to stay up-to-date
        on the
        latest security trends and technologies to help maintain my expertise in the field. I am also passionate about sharing knowledge with my team and finding better ways to make technical knowledge more accessible to a non-technical audience. I
        hope
        to translate my current experience to a professional setting and help my future employer protect their sensitive data.</p>
